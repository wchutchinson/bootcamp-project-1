//QUESTIONS

//Do I need to match the classes for the smallButton1 and smallButton2 to the ones in the html and CSS files?

//Do I need to add the script.js file to the html file or is it already included in the code?

//Should I keep largeButton and largeButton2 as buttons or change them to something else?

//How do I take the changes I made and apply them to the landing page on GitHub?


//NOTES

//I need to make the two small buttons redirect to a different page when clicked.

//I need to add the links to the small buttons in the script.js file.
